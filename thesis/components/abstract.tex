We compare the most common intrinsic metrics, namely the geodesic, the diffusion, the commute-time and the biharmonic distance.
In order to do so, we first introduce the concept of metric spaces and apply it to the space of three dimensional surfaces.
After presenting the basic concepts of differential geometry on regular surfaces, we define the different metrics first in the continuous setting and then show ways to discretize them to triangular meshes.
We further introduce our experiments to measure the qualitative performance of the intrinsic metrics on different meshes and give some insight into their implementation.
Finally we find, that the biharmonic distance satisfies most of the preferable properties of an intrinsic metric, while the other distances have more specialized strenghts.
