%usage of the toolbox_graph, geodesic from google code
%matlab, choice of the approximation instead of the exact solutions, diffusion with times scaled to have scale invariance
This chapter will concentrate on the specific implementation choices during the testing process.
The main software used to run the computations is Matlab R2014a under GNU/Linux 3.14.
%TODO add the online citations of those two
In addition to that, we used a collection of functions for graphs and meshes called ``Toolbox Graph'' from the official Matlab file exchange and an implementation of the geodesic distance as described in \ref{section:geodesic} taken from Google Code.
