%usage of the toolbox_graph, geodesic from google code
%matlab, choice of the approximation instead of the exact solutions, diffusion with times scaled to have scale invariance
\section{Setup}
This chapter will concentrate on the specific implementation choices during the testing process.
The main software used to run the computations is Matlab R2014a under GNU/Linux 3.14.
%TODO add the online citations of those two
In addition to that, we used a collection of functions for graphs and meshes called ``Toolbox Graph'' from the official Matlab file exchange\cite{online_toolbox} and an implementation of the geodesic distance as described in \ref{section:geodesic} taken from Google Code\cite{online_geodesic}.

\paragraph{The Geodesic Distance}
The implementation of the geodesic distance is written for Windows in C++, to be compiled into a shared library and then called with a Matlab API.
This resulted in a small amount of problems, most of which were small differences due to the change of the underlying operating system.
